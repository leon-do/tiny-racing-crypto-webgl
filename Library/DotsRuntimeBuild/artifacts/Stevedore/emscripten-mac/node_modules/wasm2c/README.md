# wasm2c npm package

This is an Emscripten build of wabt's
[wasm2c](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c). You can run
`wasm2c.js` exactly like you would run a native build of wasm2c, except you
don't need to build it!

For example, try running
```
nodejs wasm2c.js --help
```

This also contains the wasm2c runtime support files, which are necessary to
compile the output C file.
