# License

This artifact contains code under a number of different licenses, some
open source, some proprietary. In aggregate, the result is proprietary,
not open source. Consult these notices and the bundled license files
for details.

The file GPL-2.0.txt is included for completeness, but note that the
aggregate work (being proprietary) is not licensed under the GPL, but
rather the (likewise proprietary) "Bison GPL-exception license" (for
lack of a better name). See the Bison notice, below.
